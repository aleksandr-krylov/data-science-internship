As a result of my Data Science internship (from July 2019 to September 2019) which was a part of my bachelor's program curriculum, I executed and tested Machine Learning algorithms for stock analysis on a limited market data from Moscow Stock Exchange by performing time series clustering and stock price prediction. The following was done:
* scraped trading data over a three-day period using Moscow Stock Exchange API;
* implemented a custom data sampler in Python;
* created a dataset for regression task by doing feature and label engineering;
* feature selection with scikit-learn, dimensionality reduction with PCA, clustering analysis with KMeans, and statistical analysis with Pandas.
